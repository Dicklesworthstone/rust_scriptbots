# Phase 2 WebAssembly TODOs (Codex, 2025-10-22)

- [x] Guard Rayon usage across wasm pathways
  - [x] Audit `scriptbots-core` and consumers for `#[cfg(feature = "parallel")]` coverage
  - [x] Ensure workspace avoids linking Rayon for wasm builds (crate features / dependency pruning)
  - [x] Add documentation note on disabling parallelism for wasm builds
- [x] Extend `scriptbots-web` data interchange options
  - [x] Add binary snapshot export (`postcard` or similar) alongside JSON
  - [x] Expose snapshot format toggle in `InitOptions`
  - [x] Document snapshot APIs in `web/README.md`
- [x] Improve brain selection ergonomics for wasm
  - [x] Allow JS callers to choose seeding strategy (`wander` vs `none`)
  - [x] Stub registration pathway for future `scriptbots-brain` bindings (documented opt-in)
- [x] Strengthen parity/regression tests
  - [x] Expand wasm-vs-native parity test across multiple seeds/ticks
  - [x] Add float tolerance helper (with diagnostics) reused across assertions
  - [x] Run parity test under `wasm-pack test --headless`
- [x] Integrate wasm tests into CI
  - [x] Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with `wasm-pack build` + headless Chrome job
  - [x] Install Chrome/Chromium on CI runner and cache wasm-pack artifacts
  - [x] Ensure job runs on PRs + main branch
- [x] Polish Canvas demo harness
  - [x] Add lightweight benchmarking log (FPS, TPS over time)
  - [x] Document serving instructions (without bundler) & add npm script/Make target
  - [x] Clarify reset/seed controls in UI and README
- [x] Update project docs
  - [x] Amend `PLAN_TO_CREATE_SIBLING_APP_CRATE_TARGETING_WASM.md` for new snapshot formats, brain options, CI steps
  - [x] Add brief note to `README.md` pointing to wasm harness
- [ ] WebGPU rendering spike (Phase 3.1)
  - [ ] Implement instanced WebGPU pipeline and benchmark vs Canvas
  - [ ] Capture FPS/CPU metrics on Chrome + Safari Technology Preview
  - [ ] Document fallback behaviour and feature detection in harness
- [ ] Input & camera controls (Phase 3.2)
  - [ ] Mirror GPUI pan/zoom/pause/selection interactions in web harness
  - [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts and HUD indicators for control state
- [ ] Diagnostics overlay parity (Phase 3.4)
  - [ ] Render tick rate / population charts in browser
  - [ ] Surface observable toggles (velocity vectors, sensing cones)
- [ ] Persistence & analytics prototype (Phase 4)
  - [ ] Implement in-browser snapshot ring buffer with download/export
  - [ ] Evaluate DuckDB-wasm or IndexedDB fallback for analytics storage
- [ ] Bundled developer workflow
  - [ ] Decide on Vite/esbuild/no-bundler approach and codify scripts
  - [ ] Provide npm/task runner commands for build + serve
